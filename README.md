# snaketwodpico
A static webserver running on the Raspberry Pi Pico w

I wanted to build a game serever in the Pi pico and I wanted it to be only based out of HTML and CSS and no Javasript because i did not know how to use javascript.
I found the html code for the snake game here - [https://onecompiler.com/html/3xfp94w5a](url)
I found the python code here on page 23 - [https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/picow/connecting-to-the-internet-with-pico-w.pdf](url)

I replaced pico w and hello world with the code in the first link.
